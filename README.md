# senior_design_juggling_robot
This is the public repository for the source code used in the Juggling Robot senior design project at Columbia University.

This repository contains the source code for a robot that is capable of throwing a ball from one hand, and catching it in the other. 
The robot was run off of a Raspbery Pi, with all control software written in C++, using the PIGPIO library. 

The path planning directory contains various MATLAB scripts and functions that were used for path planning and trajectory planning, along with a rudimentary physics engine used to visualize and simulates the movement of the robot's hand and the ball.

The motor_test_software directory contains varous test scripts for running encoders and motors with the PIGPIO library. 

The robot_software directory contains all the final code used for robot operation.

We hope you will find this repository to be a useful starting point in your own robotics projects.
